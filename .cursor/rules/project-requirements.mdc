# Project Requirements

## Overview
A single-page website built with **TypeScript**, **SvelteKit**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Chart.js**. The site displays an interactive graph that updates in real time as users adjust parameter sliders.

## Technology Stack
- **TypeScript**: Ensures strong typing and code clarity.
- **SvelteKit**: Provides a reactive, single-page application framework.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid, responsive UI development.
- **Chart.js**: Renders dynamic, interactive graphs.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Real-time Updates**: Graph updates immediately as slider values change.
2. **Interactive Sliders**: Sliders control parameters affecting the graph.
3. **Responsive Design**:
   - **Desktop**: Sliders and graph are shown side-by-side.
   - **Mobile**: Sliders are accessible via a collapsible menu.
4. **Dynamic Interactions**: All updates occur via SvelteKit’s reactivity—no page reloads.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- Leverage SvelteKit’s built-in reactivity (e.g., reactive declarations using `$:`) to update UI components immediately.
- Ensure Typescript components use proper typing.
- Code should separate concerns clearly.
- UI should be designed for mobile first, ensuring that the slider controls are wrapped in a collapsible container.
- On wider screens and desktops, the slider controls should be side-by-side with the graphs.
